# Hybrid GNN Power Grid OPF optimization
This repository implements a hybrid intelligence system for real-time, physics-aware power grid optimization. It blends GNNs, Classical AC-OPF solvers, and reinforcement learning. The goal is to accelerate Optimal Power Flow (OPF).
# Hybrid GNN–Solver Framework for Power Grid Optimization

This repository implements a hybrid intelligence system that combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with classical Optimal Power Flow (OPF) solvers. The goal is to achieve fast, physics-aware power grid optimization while maintaining feasibility and scalability across different grid sizes.
