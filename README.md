# Hybrid GNN–Solver Framework for Power Grid Optimization

This repository implements a hybrid intelligence system that combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with classical Optimal Power Flow (OPF) solvers. The goal is to achieve fast, physics-aware power grid optimization while maintaining feasibility and scalability across different grid sizes.


##  Features

1. Graph-structured modeling of power grids  
2. Implementations of multiple GNN architectures:
  - GCN  
  - GraphSAGE  
  - GAT  
3. Hybrid solver: GNN warm-start for AC-OPF solvers  
4. PPO reinforcement learning module (optional)  
5. Modular, extensible codebase  
6. Scalable from small to large IEEE bus systems
